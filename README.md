## What Is This?
Starting a new job or getting a new boss or coworker can be challenging. I want to help take the guesswork out of what it's like to work with me.

## About Me
I'm a family man with two daughters. I grew up in Dallas and love the outdoors. I've spent years training in Jiu-Jitsu and enjoy camping and hiking in national parks. I also love learning new things, especially when I travel.

Professionally, I've been building software since 2001 and am passionate about using technology to solve meaningful problems. I've worked in various roles in companies of all sizes, from software developer to program manager. For a professional summary, check out my LinkedIn, and feel free to connect!

## My Job
*My focus is to:*
* Foster a high-performing team where everyone feels fulfilled and passionate about their work.
* Set a clear vision and priorities, empowering you to make decisions that align with our goals.

## Personal Principles and Values
* *I am your champion.* Your success and well-being are important to me. I'll give you honest feedback, but it comes from a place of wanting to see you and the team succeed.
* *I'm always learning.* I'm open to feedback and always looking to improve.
* *I serve the customer's needs.* The customer comes first in everything we do.
* *I love data.* Data helps us make informed decisions and find new opportunities.
* *I have fun by pushing on convention.* I enjoy solving challenging problems in innovative ways with a like-minded team.
* *I seek balance.* I understand the importance of work-life balance and will work to ensure you can maintain that balance, too.

## Quirks
I have quirks. I appreciate your patience. Please keep the channels of communication open and let me know if I’m being too quirky for you.
* *Unconventional.* I like to push against what we think we know. That may mean that I have crazy suggestions--they could be. But, sometimes, we need 100% or 200% improvement, not 5%. I love making those huge leaps. And to find those huge leaps, you may have to throw off the safety of conventional wisdom and wade into the inky waters of uncertainty. That said, sometimes I am ignorant of factors of which you are aware. I encourage you to push back. And I still might ask you to wade into the blackness with me. I’ll have your back while we do it.
* *I can seem intimidating.* I have a resting-grumpy face. I blame my parents. :shrug: If you’re unsure if I’m upset, I’m probably not. Call me on it. I’ll clarify or fix it.

## What I hope to see from our team
* *We have empathy for each other.* We see others as people, not vehicles, obstacles, or irrelevancies. In our design and implementation, we consider the long line of people who will have to touch our software. We should understand the "Outward Mindset."
* *We own our...* success and failure, the achievement of our objectives, and our celebrations of success. We work together to learn from failure without blame, listen to other ideas, and collaborate with the people who can make real change happen.
* *We understand why.* Why are we doing this? Ask yourself and each other “why” until you really know why. When we understand the “why” a magical thing happens--we leverage our collective IQ to make the solution even more impressive. Our efforts, solutions, and best work are all aimed at the same target.
* *We leave room for change.* Things always change—products, people, processes, businesses, technology. We invest appropriately in considering options and then move quickly. We give ourselves time to adjust in the future. We may make decisions because there isn't time to make a different one.We are always learning and looking for opportunities to learn. academic, personal, team, and organizational. We find happiness in improvement. We decide, measure, and adjust. We study and share. We listen. We speak up.

## 1 on 1s
Our 1:1s are primarily for you. I want to know what’s at the top of your mind. What’s keeping you up at night or stressing you out? What’s exciting/discouraging you? Where are you struggling/excelling? How can I help you troubleshoot projects, processes, relationships, or technologies? Am I doing well, and where can I improve? How can I support you? How can the organization help you? 

Don’t wait for our 1:1 to bring up urgent items.

## My Calendar
Always feel free to drop something on my calendar. It’s sometimes the best way to make sure we talk. I'll make time if my calendar is full and you need to speak sooner. Message me or call me (see Digital Communication).

## Digital Communication
If you’re not sure if you should tell me or raise something as urgent, you probably should. I’d prefer you lean towards over-communication.
1. Email - I read email daily in the evening. Do not use email to communicate urgent matters. Sometimes, email is a great way to document a conversation or post a lengthier explanation. If you need my attention, please let me know over chat.
1. Slack (or whatever chat) - Yes, please. I will likely end up in many rooms, so if you want to make sure I read something, direct-mention me. Due to the volume of messages, I might not read @here. It may take me an hour or three to see your Slack message. When talking to someone in person or in a meeting, I try to keep my attention on the people in the room.
1. Text - Text is best for off-hours when you want to hear back from me within an hour or if I’m in a meeting and not watching Slack.
1. Phone - Urgent. Get my attention in a meeting. Wake me up.
